What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    Start all the git shit goin playa. git init that muhfucka.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    It's like the pre-cum equivalent of the commit, you haven't busted your nut yet but it's ready.
