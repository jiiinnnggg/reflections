How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
    Who the f*** cares? Seriously, this is s***.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
    It's easier to see who f***ed s*** up rather than guessing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
    It's a little more logical but still annoying to do if there's a s***load of code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
    It makes more sense to save multiple files in conjunction for code in Git. Google Docs is just random text files that nobody gives a s*** about.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    Just type the f***ing thing into git bash in the repository folder.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    Cauz you can just go back to the version that was fine before you f***ed things up.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    ???
